title: "Carbon Budget Reality"
description: "The math of climate change presents us with a stark reality: the fossil fuel industry's published reserves alone would push us far beyond safe climate limits. Current confirmed oil and gas reserves would release approximately 1000 gigatons of CO2 if burned - yet our remaining carbon budget for a reasonable chance of limiting warming to 1.5°C is only half that amount."

### The Scale of Disconnect

The fundamental numbers reveal the extent of our challenge:
- Global carbon budget remaining for 1.5°C: ~500 gigatons CO2
- Current oil and gas reserves: ~1000 gigatons CO2
- Additional coal reserves: Several hundred gigatons CO2

Despite growing awareness of climate targets, the fossil fuel industry continues expanding its reserves and infrastructure. New exploration projects are being approved, long-term production facilities are under construction, and investment in fossil fuel extraction continues to grow. This trajectory stands in direct opposition to what climate science demands.

This isn't just about long-term planning - it's about immediate action. Every new fossil fuel project approved today locks in decades of future emissions and makes our climate goals increasingly unattainable. The carbon budget isn't just shrinking - it's being actively overcommitted through current business decisions.

Simply reducing emissions gradually isn't enough anymore. We need a fundamental transformation in how energy investments are made and evaluated. This requires new frameworks for decision-making that align financial flows with climate imperatives. The carbon budget reality forces us to confront difficult questions about energy security, economic stability, and development. It challenges us to reimagine how we power our world while ensuring reliable energy access for all.
