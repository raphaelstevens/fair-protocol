Global temperatures have already breached 1.5Â°C of warming temporarily, with 2023 and 2024 setting alarming new records. This is no longer a future threat but a present reality, making the transformation of our energy systems an immediate imperative rather than a long-term consideration.

Current published oil and gas reserves far exceed the remaining carbon budget for a safe and stable climate. The continued expansion of fossil fuel investments is fundamentally incompatible with maintaining a livable planet, demanding an urgent transformation in energy investment decisions.

The transition to clean energy requires investments of $4 trillion annually by 2030, yet current investments fall significantly short at $1.8 trillion. Traditional financing approaches are proving inadequate to drive this unprecedented scale of capital reallocation.

{{< section icon="triangle-alert" size="32" title="Stranded Asset Risk" >}}

Without proactive transition planning, up to 40% of fossil fuel assets risk becoming stranded as climate regulations tighten. This represents a major financial stability risk that could trigger severe economic disruption if not managed systematically.

{{< section icon="clock" size="32" title="Historical Context" >}}

Past energy crises demonstrate how critical energy security is for economic and social stability. The transition to clean energy must address both climate imperatives and energy security needs, learning from historical precedents like Denmark's successful pivot to wind power.
