title: "Asset Stranding Risk"
description: "Asset stranding is a growing financial risk that occurs when investments become worthless before the end of their planned lifetime. For the fossil fuel industry, this isn't a distant possibility but an increasing probability as climate regulations tighten and clean energy alternatives become more competitive."

### The Scale of Financial Impact

The potential losses from stranded assets are staggering. Current analysis indicates key vulnerabilities:
- 40% of fossil fuel assets risk becoming stranded
- Major oil companies face potential losses exceeding four years of profits
- Financial exposure extends throughout the banking and insurance sectors

The risk extends far beyond energy companies themselves. Financial institutions face exposure through direct lending to fossil fuel projects, investment portfolios with significant energy holdings, and insurance coverage of at-risk infrastructure. This creates potential systemic risks to the global financial system.

Delaying action only magnifies these risks. Every year of continued fossil fuel infrastructure expansion creates more potentially stranded assets. This compounds the challenge by making the eventual transition more disruptive and increasing the likelihood of sudden policy changes. The impacts ripple through affected communities, threatening jobs and economic stability.

Rather than face sudden asset stranding, we need a planned transition that protects both environmental and economic stability. This isn't the first time our energy systems have faced transformative challenges. Past energy crises offer valuable lessons about managing large-scale transitions while maintaining economic stability and energy security.
