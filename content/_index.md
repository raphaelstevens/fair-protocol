Current global fossil fuel reserves vastly exceed what we can safely burn while staying within critical climate limits. As major energy companies continue expanding their carbon investments, we face a stark choice: either fail to halt fossil fuel extraction in time to prevent climate disaster, or risk severe economic disruption from rushed regulatory interventions. This calls for an urgent transformation in how we make energy investment decisions.

{{< section icon="shield-check" size="32" title="The Solution" >}}
The FAIR Protocol introduces an innovative accounting provision that embeds carbon transition directly into financial decision-making. By requiring companies to provision for the replacement of fossil assets with clean energy, FAIR creates a systematic pathway for decarbonization while protecting financial stability and energy security.

{{< section icon="git-merge" size="32" title="Implementation" >}}
FAIR's implementation leverages existing financial frameworks and governance structures, requiring coordinated action from accounting bodies, financial institutions, energy companies and regulators. Our roadmap provides a clear pathway for adoption, supported by case studies and precedents from successful energy transitions.
